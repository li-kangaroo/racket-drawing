TODO:


Combine similar functions into a single function. For example, getting a vector cell to point to a struct and getting a vector cell
to point to another vector should be combined (see next point)

Image getters - one for each class, that can be used as arguments for the singular *point-arrow* function.

COMPLETED:
(DONE) All forms of positioning should be controlled by Canvas, allow canvas to position cons nodes

(RESOLVED) Implementing tags of picts to facilitate replacing/deleting sub-picts
- Deemed unnecessary, can use conditionals instead

(DONE) Allow for creation of arbitrary structs which can interface with Canvas

Example code for creating diagrams from slides 01 and 02

Customizability: More optional (keyword) arguments for things like arrow angle, min width of vector box, which part of an item a pointer points to
